                <p>This project arose from a request by a spokesperson for the Longhouse of Kanehsatà:ke. Unlike the
                    Band Council, the Longhouse does not answer to the Canadian federal government but instead
                    adheres
                    to the ancestral constitution of the Rotinonshonni (Iroquois) Confederacy, known as the
                    Kaianerehkowa (Great Peace). This spokesperson will remain anonymous as they undertake their
                    work at
                    significant personal risk.

                                Geography, Planning, and Environment Department. She is dedicating her research to
                                making maps and other data-driven visualizations expanding the ways we think and talk
                                about dispossession in Canada, and specifically in Quebec. As a cartographer, she
                                experiments with design to find different ways to engage both settler and Indigenous
                                communities around the land-based issues that unite and divide them. For this, she
                                assesses the potential and limits of repatriating state-sanctioned colonial materials
                                and repurposing them as “counter-archives”. With this information in hand, she produces
                                maps and other creative repurposings to augment the ways Indigenous-led political
                                campaigns reach their target audiences.
