                    Louis Guy, then general surveyor, created the first cadaster for the Seminary of Saint Sulpice
                    in 1798.
                    To define our area of study, we had to georeference the digital image of Louis Guy’s
                    1798 cadaster of the Seigneurie du Lac des Deux Montagnes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title">What is georeferencing?</h1>
                    <div class="spacer"></div>

                    <p>
                        Georeferencing is the name given to the process of transforming a scanned map or aerial
                        photograph, so it appears “in place” in a Geographic Information System (GIS). By associating
                        features on the scanned image with real-world x and y coordinates, the software can
                        progressively warp the image, so it fits to other spatial datasets. The result will create a new
                        raster dataset for use in GIS.
                    </p>

                        Luis Guy’s cadaster does not chart all the land in the seigneurie. To obtain the full cadaster,
                        we had to complement it with information from <a href="sources.html">10 other cadasters</a> of
                        the area obtained at
                        Quebec’s National Library and Archives.
                        In the case below we can see the larger map of the Seigneurie of Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes (1798)
                        overlayed with smaller map of Paroisse de L’Annonciation du Lac (1879).
                    </p>
                    <div class="spacer"></div>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Once the reconstituted cadaster was completed and georeferenced, we traced each lot as
                        rectangular polygons. Doing this precisely was only possible because most of the lots in the
                        seigneurie were designed for agricultural use. The lot borders have been maintained for 250
                        years without too much interference and are still visible today on a satellite image.
                        Unfortunately, precision faltered around the Maribel Airport area which drastically changed the
                        landscape in the 1970s.</p>

                    <p>
                        To draw the original lots in the municipality of Oka, we overlayed a current dataset from
                        Natural
                        Resources Canada with the cadaster of Oka made in 1879. From this overlay, we were able to trace
                        the original larger lot, out of which smaller lots would eventually be taken. A handful of lots
                        needed to be completely redrawn. Like puzzle pieces, the checkered pattern of the cadaster
                        helped us infer where the lot could be in comparison to other known lots.

                    <p>
                        In collaboration with the Kanehsatakeró:non Land Defender, we decided which archival data were
                        important to map and which aspects were outside the scope of the research. Our first decision
                        was to focus on mapping the first act of concession/sale rather than trace the history of
                        transactions for each lot from its creation to today. This is because the size of the area, the
                        time frame, the list of owners in a single lot and the number of subdivisions were too extensive
                        for more detail. It became more pertinent to visualize the moment the land was transferred to
                        the possession of settlers and made inaccessible to the Kanehsatakeró:non. We associated each of
                        the deeds of concession to their corresponding lots on the map.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, this deed of concession tells us the lot number 137, which can be found on the
                        cadaster. We can then attach the name of the Sulpician, Etienne Montgolfier, the date of
                        concession June 9th 1780 and the name of the settler, Henri Grandmaison to the attribute table
                        in GIS.

                        The area that eventually became the municipality of Oka consisted of 333 individual lots, and
                        these were not part of the land concessions granted in the 18th and 19th centuries. Instead,
                        these lots were sold individually, with transactions occurring between 1846 and 1930. To
                        incorporate this information into the map, we had to access the Quebec Land Registry.
                        <br><br>
                        In this excerpt from the Quebec Land Registry Database, the original deed of sale from the
                        Seminary to a settler is highlighted along with the deed registration number and date.

                    <p>
                        Finding the original sale of certain properties in the Quebec Land Registry before 1880 could be
                        tricky. This is because the index of properties, known as the 'index aux immeubles,' only
                        started in 1880. So, any sales made by the Sulpicians before that year wouldn't show up in the
                        index.
                        <br><br>
                        Sometimes, even when a sale is recorded, it might only cover a portion of the land. For
                        instance, if the Sulpicians sold a piece of land in 1870, and the buyer didn't sell it until
                        1890, the index would only show the 1890 sale, not the 1870 one. This means that the Sulpicians'
                        transactions might not be visible in these cases.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, there's a possibility that the 1870 sale was for the entire property, but the 1890
                        sale only covered a part of it. To work around this issue, we spent hours examining handwritten
                        deeds of sale. These documents sometimes mention the previous owner if the notary had been
                        thorough in their work. This helped us trace back the history of these properties more
                        accurately.
                        <br><br>
                        In this case, the notary, Joseph Girard, recorded the name of the owners, the Sulpicians, and
                        the person who purchased this lot, Regis Lefebrve.

                        When we couldn’t find the dates and names in the deeds of concession or the Quebec Land
                        Registry, we turned to the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. We found 41 Names in
                        the “livres de renvoi and cadastres abrégés”.

                        1830 lots that compose the seigneurie, a success rate of 93% overall. However, this certainty
                        rate is not evenly distributed across time periods.
