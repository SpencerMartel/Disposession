                        Wa’tkwanonwerá:ton - Warm Greetings to you All
                        <br><br>

                        We write you as a concerned group of people in Kanehsatà:ke. We choose to remain anonymous due
                        to the current state of lawlesness and danger in our community.
                        <br><br>

                        This letter is a plea for help to restore Kanehsatake to a safe and healthy place to live. In
                        our community right now:

                        <li>Mother Earth is being destroyed by various dump sites and toxic waste from the island of
                            Montreal<a href="#references-anchor"><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
                        <li>Dangerous criminal activity, including automatic gunfire in broad daylight, goes unchecked
                            and threatens the safety of our young and old<a href="#references-anchor"><sup>2</sup></a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>The land is being stolen piece by piece by land developers and assimilated Mohawks treating
                            Kanien’kehá:ka Homelands as if they were all for the taking<a
                                href="#references-anchor"><sup>3</sup></a>.</li>
                        <br><br>

                        On all of the above, the colonial governments of so-called Canada and so-called Québec remain
                        silent. Our colonial Band Council, The Mohawk Council of Kanehsatà:ke (MCK), has done very
                        little, almost never consults or informs community members, and acknowledges that organized
                        crime holds the upper hand in the application of local laws. From what we can see, this
                        situation has no end in sight.
                        <br><br>

                        All people have the right to have their basic fundamental needs met. The first foundational need
                        is to feel safe. The people of Kanehsatà:ke have not felt safe for multiple generations now.
                        <br><br>

                        We want to reclaim our community and this is a call for help, support and access to a legal
                        remedy, which Kanehsatà:ke has been denied time and time again. We need your help now for peace
                        to come to our community, something we have wanted for centuries now.
                        <br><br>

                        Here is what we are asking of decision-makers at different levels:
                        <br><br>
                        <li>We urgently want some support to ensure the peace and safety of our community members on a
                            daily basis in the Kanehsatà:ke.</li>
                        <li> We request a Parliamentary Special Committee to investigate the corruption which has led to
                            lawlessness in our community and the responsibilities of the Federal Government, the
                            Government of Québec, the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake (MCK), the Municipality of Oka as
                            well as local land developers and organized crime syndicates, in the creation of the current
                            situation.</li>
                        <li>For the government of Canada, who in 1990 promised that they would resolve the longstanding
                            historical land issues, to engage discussions with the Rotinonshón:ni (Longhouse members),
                            who are the titleholders of treaties. As well, we want our land situation to be settled in a
                            peaceful atmosphere without any threats of retribution against those who speak out.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        Ultimately, we request an independent investigation by an international team, into the
                        collusion by all levels of governments and institutions, including the Mohawk Council of
                        Kanesatake and the Seminary of St. Sulpice, which dispossessed the Kanien’kehá:ka of our
                        Homelands, as well as land developers and resource extraction corporations that participated
                        in this land dispossession, supported by Canada and Québec.
                        <br><br>

                        We are the people trying to reclaim our community of Kanehsatà:ke hear our plea and step up to
                        help.
                        <br><br>
