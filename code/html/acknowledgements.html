                <div class="text">Léa Denieul-Pinsky is a Ph.D candidate at Concordia University’s Geography,
                    Planning,
                    and Environment Department. She is dedicating her research to advance data driven visualizations to
                    end
                    the dispossession of Indigenous lands in Canada. As a cartographer, she experiments with design to
                    find
                    different ways to engage both settler and Indigenous communities around the land-based issues that
                    both
                    unite and divide them. For this, she assesses the potential and limits of repatriating
                    state-sanctioned
                    colonial materials and repurposing them as “counter-archives”. With this information in hand, she
                    produces maps and other creative repurposings to augment the ways Indigenous-led campaigns reach
                    their
                    target audiences.</div>

                    (Honours) and
                    an M.A in Human Geography. His main scholarly interests relate to the relationship between settler
                    colonial governance and knowledge production. His thesis Performing Indigenous well-being:
                    Historical
                    and political geographies of Canada's community well-being index explored the politics of state
                    knowledge production about Indigenous peoples’ well-being. He is also interested in
                    Indigenous-settler
                    relations in socio-environmental struggles.</div>
