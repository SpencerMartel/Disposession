This repo is an accompaniment to Léa Denieul-Pinsky's research. Léa is a Ph.D candidate at Concordia University’s Geography, Planning, and Environment Department dedicating her research to to strengthening alliances that engage settler and Indigenous communities around the land-based issues that unite and divide them. For this, she assesses the potential and limits of repatriating state-sanctioned historical materials and repurposing them as “counter-archives”.
