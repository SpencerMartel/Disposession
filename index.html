            <div class="text english">Approximately 540 square kilometers of Indigenous territory, comprising around
                1830
                individual parcels, were gradually allocated to European settlers over a span of two centuries.
                Today, a mere fraction, less than 2% of the original land, remains for the Mohawk of
                Kanehsatà:ke. This stark reality sheds light on the somber consequences of settler colonialism
                in the historical Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, situated within the present-day
                Deux-Montagnes Regional County Municipality in the Laurentides administrative region of
                Quebec, Canada.<br><br>
                The area gained significant notoriety during the Oka Crisis, or the siege of Kanehsatà:ke,
                when the Mohawk people confronted the Sureté Quebec (SQ), the Royal Canadian Mounted
                Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Army. This bold stand aimed to protect their sacred lands
                from being transformed into a golf course for Oka residents. This intense 78-day military
                standoff not only shook the nation but laid bare the persistent and deeply unjust structures
                at the core of land based conflicts today.
                But the Oka crisis was just the tip of the iceberg. The roots of this conflict stretch back nearly
                three centuries.<br><br>

                In Quebec, the seigneurial system governed and distributed land from the 16th to the 19th
                century. The “seigneurs” were often French nobles, merchants or religious congregations,
                who had been granted large pieces of the land by the French Crown. The Sulpicians, a French
                society of diocesan priests, are often described as wealthy educated elites, academics and
                missionaries, they were first and foremost powerful and influential landowners. They were the
                Seigneurs of the island of Montreal for almost 200 years (1663 to 1854) in addition to the
                Seigneurie they administered in the Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and the Seigneurie de SaintSulpice.
                In the early 1700s, the Sulpicians were granted around 540 km2
                of land by the King of France.
                The purpose was to establish the Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and displace a
                Mohawk group (Kanien’kehá:ka) that had converted to Catholicism, known as the "Mission
                Indians," to distance them from burgeoning settler towns on the island of Montreal. Yet,
                <a href="https://www.kanehsatakevoices.com/at-the-woods-edge/" , target="none">Kanien’kehá:ka oral
                    traditions and archaeological evidence</a> point to another faction of
                Kanien’kehá:ka (Kanehsatakeró:non) having inhabited the land long before the Sulpicians'
                arrival, and the French land grant.<br><br>
                The Sulpicians and the British assured the Mohawk that the land in the Seigneurie du
                Lacdes-Deux-Montagnes was theirs to live on. In 1721 the Mohawk made the Two Dog
                Wampum as a chain of friendship to confirm this commitment and bind the Sulpicians to
                their responsibilities and obligations.<div class="spacer"></div>

                    told us we

                    Indians should live on this Island, and that if we would consent to go and settle at the
                    Lake of Two Mountains we should have a large tract of land for which we should have
                    a Deed from the King of France as our property, to be vested in us and our Heirs
                    forever, and that we should not be molested again in our habitations. Altho’ it was
                    very inconvenient to us to be quitting our houses and small clearings, yet the desire of
                    having a fixed property of our own induced us to comply, and we accordingly set out
                    and took possession of the Land assigned to us, and as was the custom of our
                    Forefather, we immediately set about making a Belt (which we now deliver to you)”</div>

            <div class="text english">Although the Kanehsata'keró:non repeatedly delivered this Two Dog Wampum to
                British
                officials to honor their promise and protect the land from white settlement, the
                British upheld that the Sulpician priests were the sole owners of the land. As the
                Mohawks’(Kanehsatakeró:non) rights and title to the land were never formally recognized,
                they became dependent upon the Sulpicians to hold for them “in trust.” However, the
                Sulpicians broke their obligations and sold 98% of the land to settlers, the descendants of
                whom still live on the land and celebrate the Sulpican’s heritage today.

                </div>
                After a Seigneurie was granted, the “seigneur” or lord had a surveyor map the lots to be
                conceded (the cadaster). In a registry (the “terrier”), each lot was recorded along with the
                name of the “censitaire” (the settler paying to use the land) and the subsequent transactions.
                The seigneur sometimes added the details of the taxation (called cens and rents) in the
                “censier.” In their land registries the Sulpicians painstakingly recorded every property
                transaction they made with settlers for more than 200 years.

                <div class="subtitle left-leaning">The scale of dispossession
                </div>
                Land was not distributed evenly over time. Settlement seemed to happen through sharp 10
                to 30-year bursts. These bursts happened around three phases.
                <div class="subtitle left-leaning">The rhythm of dispossession</div>
                The first settlement phase from 1780 to 1809 (with a significant peak from 1790 to 1780)
                comprises primarily French farmers. They settle in the fertile lands around the côte St-Joseph,
                côte de la Baie, and les Eblouis and extend northwards. These areas constitute "la mouvance,"
                where the Sulpicians collect feudal taxes (cens and rentes) according to their affirmed title to
                the land.

            It’s hard to say how much was made because land sale amounts were not consistently
            recorded. What we do know is:
            <div class="right-leaning">
                <ul>
                    <li>Between 1790 and 1824, Quebecois historian Christian Dessureault (1979) estimates
                    that the Sulpicians made 290 027 livres (4 818 907 $ in 2023) collecting taxes (le
                    champart, les banalités, les droits casuels , les cens et rentes).</li>
                    <li>In 1859, The Canadian federal government payed a first installment of 157 413 CA$
                    (when the seigneurial system was abolished in 1854.)</li>
                    <li>Despite the abolition of the seigneurial regime 80% of the censitaires (the settlers
                    paying to use the land) ended up paying “rentes constituées“ for the next 80 years.
                    <li>The abolition of the seigneurial regime granted the seigneurs full possession of
                    domain lands in the municipality of Oka, to which were added the unconceded spaces
                    in the Seigneury. This provision of the law testifies to the legislator's very favorable
                    attitude towards the seigneurs and his desire to preserve their property rights at all
                    costs, even if it meant depriving the Kanehsatakeró:non of even more land.</li>
                    <li>In 1935, the National Commission for the Repurchase of Seigneurial Rents (SNRRS)
                    paid 51 835 CA$ (1 131 730 CA$ in 2023) the trustees of the commercial property of
                    Saint-Sulpice. This money served to redress the Sulpicians finances in a moment
                    where a series of bad investments had placed them under governmental trusteeship
                    from 1937 to 1960.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            This map documents the history of land dispossession in the Seigneurie du Lac-des-DeuxMontagnes from 1780 to
            1960. It records for each parcel of land (in white) the dates they were
            taken from the Mohawk through sale or concession, identifies the Sulpicians responsible for
            these actions (when possible), and lists the names of the settlers who received these parcels of
            land.
            To navigate through the information, you can use the panel on the right-hand side. You have
            the option to search through the database or directly enter a specific address. If you want to
            visually experience the process of dispossession unfolding over time, you can click the "[]"
            button, which will allow you to see the changes dynamically on the map.
