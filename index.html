            <div class="introduction-text">
                540 square kilometers of Indigenous land, divided into 1830 individual parcels, were gradually allocated
                to European settlers over a span of two centuries. Today, a mere fraction, less than 2% of the original
                land, remains for the Mohawk of Kanehsatà:ke (the Kanehsatakeró:non). This research presents what
                dispossession looks like in the historical Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, situated within the
                present day Laurentides administrative region of Quebec, Canada.
                <br><br>

                The area gained national attention during the Oka Crisis, also known as the siege of Kanehsatà:ke, when
                the Mohawk people took a courageous stand against the Sureté Quebec (SQ), the Royal Canadian Mounted
                Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Army. Their goal was to protect their sacred lands from being
                transformed into a golf course for Oka residents. This intense 78-day military standoff not only shook
                the nation at its core but also laid bare the enduring and deeply unjust structures underlying
                contemporary land-based conflicts.
                <br><br>

                But the Oka crisis is just the tip of the iceberg. The roots of this conflict stretch back nearly three
                centuries.

                In Quebec, the seigneurial system governed and distributed land from the 16th to the 19th century. Under
                this system, the "seigneurs" typically comprised French nobles, merchants, or religious congregations,
                who had received vast land grants from the French Crown. Among these seigneurs were the Sulpicians, a
                French society of diocesan priests, often known for their roles as wealthy, educated elites, academics,
                and missionaries. However, it's essential to recognize that they were first and foremost powerful and
                influential landowners. They were the Seigneurs of the island of Montreal for almost 200 years (1663 to
                1854) in addition to the Seigneurie they administered in the Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and the Seigneurie
                de Saint-Sulpice.
                <br><br>

                In the early 1700s, the Sulpicians were granted around 540 km2 of land by the King of France. The
                purpose was to establish the Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and displace a Mohawk group that had
                converted to Catholicism, known as the "Mission Indians," to distance them from burgeoning settler towns
                on the island of Montreal. Yet, Mohawk oral traditions and archaeological evidence point to another
                faction of Mohawk (the Kanehsatakeró:non) having inhabited the land long before the Sulpicians' arrival,
                and the French land grant.
                <br><br>

                The Sulpicians and the British assured the Mohawk that the land in the Seigneurie du
                Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes was theirs to live on. In 1721 the Mohawk made the Two Dog Wampum as a chain of
                friendship to confirm this commitment and bind the Sulpicians to their responsibilities and obligations.
                In the words of Mohawk Chief Aughneetha, Montreal Feb. 8, 1787
                <br><br>

                <i>“our Priest (in conjunction with the Clergy of the Seminary of Montreal) told us we should remove
                    once
                    more with our Families, for that it was no longer proper that any Indians should live on this
                    Island,
                    and that if we would consent to go and settle at the Lake of Two Mountains we should have a large
                    tract
                    of land for which we should have a Deed from the King of France as our property, to be vested in us
                    and
                    our Heirs forever, and that we should not be molested again in our habitations. Altho’ it was very
                    inconvenient to us to be quitting our houses and small clearings, yet the desire of having a fixed
                    property of our own induced us to comply, and we accordingly set out and took possession of the Land
                    assigned to us, and as was the custom of our Forefather, we immediately set about making a Belt
                    (which
                    we now deliver to you)”</i><br>&emsp;&emsp;<s>&ensp;</s>&nbsp;Mohawk Chief Aughneetha, Montreal Feb.
                8, 1787.

                <div class="caption"> Two dog Wampum as described by Mohawk Chief Aughneetha.</div>
                <br><br>

                Although the Mohawk repeatedly delivered this Two Dog Wampum to British officials, officials to honor
                their promise and protect the land from white settlement, the British upheld that the Sulpician priests
                were the sole owners of the land. As the Mohawk of Kanehsatà:ke’s rights and title to the land were
                never formally recognized, they became dependent upon the Sulpicians to hold for them “in trust.”
                However, the Sulpicians broke their obligations and sold 98% of the land to settlers, the descendants of
                whom still live on the land and celebrate the Sulpician’s heritage today.

                Once a Seigneurie was granted, the “seigneur” or lord commissioned a surveyor to create a cadaster,
                mapping out the lots designated for concession. The lot numbers, along with the names of the settlers
                (known as "censitaires") and any subsequent transactions, were recorded in a registry called the
                "terrier." Additionally, the seigneur often included taxation information, referred to as "cens and
                rents," in another registry called the "censier." For more than two centuries, the Sulpicians
                meticulously documented every property transaction they made with settlers in these land registries.

                        distributed cleared land to settlers to enhance their wealth. To manage their land holdings
                        effectively, they commissioned Louis Guy, the general surveyor, to create the first cadaster in
                        1798, greatly improving tax collection and administration.

                geographical distribution, and spatial dynamics of these transactions. This information provides
                valuable insights into the colonization process and its significant impact on the people of

                Although the size of lots granted to settlers varied over time, we can observe two distinct periods.
                From 1780 to 1860, the average lot granted to a settler measured 76 acres on average. To provide some
                context, 76 acres of land is equivalent to 57 American football fields or…

                <br>

                At the end of the seigneurial regime in 1858, the lots granted to settlers became significantly smaller (36
                acres on average). This coincides with the urban development of the municipality of Oka.

                Land distribution did not occur uniformly over time. Instead, settlement happened in sharp bursts
                lasting approximately 10 to 30 years. These bursts can be identified across three distinct phases in the
                historical record.

                            around 1790). Most of the settlers were French farmers. They established their homes in the
                            fertile regions around côte St-Joseph, côte de la Baie, and les Eblouis, gradually expanding
                            northward. These areas are collectively referred to as "la mouvance,". During this time, the
                            Sulpicians collected feudal taxes known as "cens and rentes" based on their claimed

                            The second phase of settlement was short but intense. 28,000 acres of land granted in just
                            10 years, from 1820 to 1829. That is equivalent to 21,200 football fields or slightly larger
                            than the entire present-day municipality of Oka. This significant increase in land
                            allocation aligns with the Sulpicians' implementation of the British monarchy's plan to
                            bring British settlers to the Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes. These British settlers
                            established their homes in the northwestern part of the seigneury. The North River ("La
                            Rivière-du-Nord") served as a natural buffer between the British and French settlements.

                            seignorial regime in 1858. During this period, the lots granted were the first instances of
                            legal land sales in the Seigneurie. Settlers could either purchase new lots and gain full
                            ownership of the land or buy the lots they had been leasing. The increase in acres granted
                            during this time could also be attributed to the significant number of Algonquin families
                            who were removed from Kanehsatà:ke to Miniwaki between 1858 and 1870, and Kanehsatakeró:non
                            families who were relocating to Gibson in 1881, freeing up more land for settlement. </td>

                    <li>Between 1790 and 1824, Quebecois historian Christian Dessureault (1979) estimates
                        that the Sulpicians made 290 027 livres (4 818 907 $ in 2023) collecting taxes (le
                        champart, les banalités, les droits casuels , les cens et rentes).</li>
                    <li>In 1859, The Canadian federal government payed a first installment of 157 413 CA$
                        (when the seigneurial system was abolished in 1854.)</li>
                    <li>Despite the abolition of the seigneurial regime 80% of the censitaires (the settlers
                        paying to use the land) ended up paying “rentes constituées“ for the next 80 years.
                    <li>The abolition of the seigneurial regime granted the seigneurs full possession of
                        domain lands in the municipality of Oka, to which were added the unconceded spaces
                        in the Seigneury. This provision of the law testifies to the legislator's very favorable
                        attitude towards the seigneurs and his desire to preserve their property rights at all
                        costs, even if it meant depriving the Kanehsatakeró:non of even more land.</li>
                    <li>In 1935, the National Commission for the Repurchase of Seigneurial Rents (SNRRS)
                        paid 51 835 CA$ (1 131 730 CA$ in 2023) the trustees of the commercial property of
                        Saint-Sulpice. This money served to redress the Sulpicians finances in a moment
                        where a series of bad investments had placed them under governmental trusteeship
                        from 1937 to 1960.</li>
