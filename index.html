                Approximately 540 square kilometers of Indigenous territory, comprising around
                1830 individual parcels, were gradually allocated to European settlers over a span of two centuries.
                Today, a mere fraction, less than 2% of the original land, remains for the Mohawk of
                Kanehsatà:ke. This stark reality sheds light on the somber consequences of settler colonialism
                in the historical Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, situated within the present-day
                Deux-Montagnes Regional County Municipality in the Laurentides administrative region of

                    The area gained significant notoriety during the Oka Crisis, or the siege of Kanehsatà:ke,
                    when the Mohawk people confronted the Sureté Quebec (SQ), the Royal Canadian Mounted
                    Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Army. This bold stand aimed to protect their sacred lands
                    from being transformed into a golf course for Oka residents. This intense 78-day military
                    standoff not only shook the nation but laid bare the persistent and deeply unjust structures
                    at the core of land based conflicts today.
                    But the Oka crisis was just the tip of the iceberg. The roots of this conflict stretch back nearly
                    three centuries.<br><br>
                    In Quebec, the seigneurial system governed and distributed land from the 16th to the 19th
                    century. The “seigneurs” were often French nobles, merchants or religious congregations,
                    who had been granted large pieces of the land by the French Crown. The Sulpicians, a French
                    society of diocesan priests, are often described as wealthy educated elites, academics and
                    missionaries, they were first and foremost powerful and influential landowners. They were the
                    Seigneurs of the island of Montreal for almost 200 years (1663 to 1854) in addition to the
                    Seigneurie they administered in the Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and the Seigneurie de SaintSulpice.
                    In the early 1700s, the Sulpicians were granted around 540 km2
                    of land by the King of France.
                    The purpose was to establish the Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and displace a
                    Mohawk group (Kanien’kehá:ka) that had converted to Catholicism, known as the "Mission
                    Indians," to distance them from burgeoning settler towns on the island of Montreal. Yet,
                    <a href="https://www.kanehsatakevoices.com/at-the-woods-edge/" , target="none">Kanien’kehá:ka oral
                        traditions and archaeological evidence</a> point to another faction of
                    Kanien’kehá:ka (Kanehsatakeró:non) having inhabited the land long before the Sulpicians'
                    arrival, and the French land grant.<br><br>
                </div>
                The Sulpicians and the British assured the Mohawk that the land in the Seigneurie du
                Lacdes-Deux-Montagnes was theirs to live on. In 1721 the Mohawk made the Two Dog
                Wampum as a chain of friendship to confirm this commitment and bind the Sulpicians to
                their responsibilities and obligations.

                        having a fixed property of our own induced us to comply, and we accordingly set out
                        and took possession of the Land assigned to us, and as was the custom of our
                        Forefather, we immediately set about making a Belt (which we now deliver to you)”</div>

                Although the Kanehsata'keró:non repeatedly delivered this Two Dog Wampum to
                British
                officials to honor their promise and protect the land from white settlement, the
                British upheld that the Sulpician priests were the sole owners of the land. As the
                Mohawks’(Kanehsatakeró:non) rights and title to the land were never formally recognized,
                they became dependent upon the Sulpicians to hold for them “in trust.” However, the
                Sulpicians broke their obligations and sold 98% of the land to settlers, the descendants of
                whom still live on the land and celebrate the Sulpican’s heritage today.

                </div>
                After a Seigneurie was granted, the “seigneur” or lord had a surveyor map the lots to be
                conceded (the cadaster). In a registry (the “terrier”), each lot was recorded along with the
                name of the “censitaire” (the settler paying to use the land) and the subsequent transactions.
                The seigneur sometimes added the details of the taxation (called cens and rents) in the
                “censier.” In their land registries the Sulpicians painstakingly recorded every property
                transaction they made with settlers for more than 200 years.

                By reconstructing the historical cadaster of the Seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and
                locating the initial deeds of sale and concession for each individual lot, we can analyze and
                understand the rhythm, geographical distribution, and spatial dynamics of these transactions.
                This information provides valuable insights into the colonization process and its significant
                impact on the people of Kanehsatà:ke.

                <div class="subtitle">The scale of dispossession
                </div>
                Land was not distributed evenly over time. Settlement seemed to happen through sharp 10
                to 30-year bursts. These bursts happened around three phases.
                <div class="spacer"></div><br>
                <div class="subtitle">The rhythm of dispossession</div>
                The first settlement phase from 1780 to 1809 (with a significant peak from 1790 to 1780)
                comprises primarily French farmers. They settle in the fertile lands around the côte St-Joseph,
                côte de la Baie, and les Eblouis and extend northwards. These areas constitute "la mouvance,"
                where the Sulpicians collect feudal taxes (cens and rentes) according to their affirmed title to
                the land.<br><br>
                The second phase of settlement was brief but intense, 28 000 acres granted in the span of 10
                years from 1820 to 1829, the equivalent of 21 200 football fields, slightly larger than the
                entire municipality of Oka today. This data spike corresponds to the Sulpicians’
                implementation of the British monarchy's plan to settle British immigrants in the Seigneurie
                du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes. The British immigrants settled in the north/west of the
                seigneury. The North River ("La Rivière-du-Nord ") provided a buffer between the British and
                the French settlements.<br><br>
                The third phase of settlement happened between 1860 and 1889 and is notable because it
                marked the end of the seignorial regime in 1858. The lots granted in this period will be the
                first legal land sales in the Seigneurie, where the settler could purchase lots and gain full title
                of the land or purchase the lot they had previously been leasing (at the value of seventeen
                years of annual taxes). The upsurge in acres granted could also be due to the large number of
                Algonquin families that moved to Miniwaki from Kanehsatà:ke between 1858 and 1870, and
                Kanehsatakeró:non families to Gibson in 1881 freeing up more land (Gabriel-Doxtater & Van
                den Hende, 1995).

                This map documents the history of land dispossession in the Seigneurie du Lac-des-DeuxMontagnes from
                1780 to
                1960. It records for each parcel of land (in white) the dates they were
                taken from the Mohawk through sale or concession, identifies the Sulpicians responsible for
                these actions (when possible), and lists the names of the settlers who received these parcels of
                land.<br><br>

            It’s hard to say how much was made because land sale amounts were not consistently
            recorded. What we do know is:
            <div class="right-leaning">
                <ul>
                    <li>Between 1790 and 1824, Quebecois historian Christian Dessureault (1979) estimates
                        that the Sulpicians made 290 027 livres (4 818 907 $ in 2023) collecting taxes (le
                        champart, les banalités, les droits casuels , les cens et rentes).</li>
                    <li>In 1859, The Canadian federal government payed a first installment of 157 413 CA$
                        (when the seigneurial system was abolished in 1854.)</li>
                    <li>Despite the abolition of the seigneurial regime 80% of the censitaires (the settlers
                        paying to use the land) ended up paying “rentes constituées“ for the next 80 years.
                    <li>The abolition of the seigneurial regime granted the seigneurs full possession of
                        domain lands in the municipality of Oka, to which were added the unconceded spaces
                        in the Seigneury. This provision of the law testifies to the legislator's very favorable
                        attitude towards the seigneurs and his desire to preserve their property rights at all
                        costs, even if it meant depriving the Kanehsatakeró:non of even more land.</li>
                    <li>In 1935, the National Commission for the Repurchase of Seigneurial Rents (SNRRS)
                        paid 51 835 CA$ (1 131 730 CA$ in 2023) the trustees of the commercial property of
                        Saint-Sulpice. This money served to redress the Sulpicians finances in a moment
                        where a series of bad investments had placed them under governmental trusteeship
                        from 1937 to 1960.</li>
